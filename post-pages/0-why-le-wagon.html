            <h2> Le Wagon Web Dev Bootcamp</h2>
              <h1> _Why this bootcamp?</h1>
              <p class="blog-quick-version">I wanted a bootcamp that involved team work and in person learning, and le Wagon
                was the only one that I found which had that.
              </p>
              <p> I joined the Le Wagon bootcamp quite suddenly after months of indecision.
                There are so many options out there for people interested in developing their tech skills,
              from bootcamps to part time computer science degrees. </p>

              <p>I eventually honed in on a few options: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Code Institute</li>
                <li>Flatiron Institute</li>
                <li>York University Computer science degree</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>I wrote York Uni off quite quickly when I read the many many reviews. It felt stressful and fastpaced, and likely to quickly
                be too much to handle part time. On top of that, there didn't seem to be much emphasis on actually coding, and that's what
                I was interested to learn: practical software development skills.
              </p>

              <p>Code Institute was a pretty strong contender, but the reviews mentioned many times that it's all recorded content,
                and when I started reading more closely I saw it was the same for most other programs. </p>

              <p class="blog-emphasis">I'm a social learner. I need community to stay motivated. The idea of spending big bucks on a program and then being
                completely at the mercy of my own self-discipline (or lack thereof) was unnerving.</p>

              <p>I did like the look of flatiron school. Great curriculum, and they seem really well organised. If I was in the US and could join them
                  on campus instead of online, I probaby would have. But it was also crazy expensive (>$13k) which put me off. </p>

              <p>It was around this time that a colleague mentioend Le Wagon in passing as something he had considered because of the in person learning.
                I didn't realise how much the lack of human contact was holding me back from committing to the other bootcamps until then, but a few days
                later it finally clicked in my head and I felt ready to commit!</p>

              <p>I think at the end of the day, it doesn't matter which program you choose. With some hard work and a bit of luck, if you have the
                right attitude you can probably get what you are looking for (or where you want to be) with any of them. </p>

              <p class="blog-emphasis">My advice is just to really think about how the format of the learning fits in with your lifestyle and your personality. </p>
              And then, follow your instinct.</p>
