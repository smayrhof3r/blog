          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>I'm a first time 'blogger', but I really benefitted from reading about <a href = "#">Becky's experience
            </a> & review of the York University part time Computer Science master program, and wanted to do 
            something similar for my experience with <a href = "#">le Wagon</a>'s part time Web Development bootcamp. 
          </p><p>  
            I'm using the opportunity to practice the skills I'm learning as I learn them, so this site will start
            rather rough around the edges (with incomplete features), and improve as I hopefully learn more and more 
            on the course. So far, I have only completed my Prep work & Setup day, so I have a lot to learn! 
          </p><p>  
            If you want to know more about why I'm doing this bootcamp, read the 'About Me' section (once I figure out how
            to set up multiple pages! ;) )

            2 weeks to cover the materials. I though that would be plenty...
